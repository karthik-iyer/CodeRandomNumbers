# CodeRandomNumbers
Code to generate list of Random numbers between 1 and 10000

## This is the project to create a list of Random numbers between 1 to 10000 including 1 and 10000. 

For maintaining a unique list of RandomNumbers everytime between 1 to 10k, I used a Hashset and the .NET Random function

## Executing the program

This is a simple .NET Core console application. 

For executing the program just run 

<b>dotnet run</b>

The above command restores nuget packages, builds and runs the program.
